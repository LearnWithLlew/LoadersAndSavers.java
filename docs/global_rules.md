1. No code comments
   Please avoid all code comments apart from # given # when # then in tests.
   Try to follow the rule that if something can be made easy to read without needing a comment by using good names and code structure, you should prefer doing that to express your intent instead of comment that just repeats the code. Only add comments when something is really not obvious from the code
2. When starting a new process, check git status to make sure that everything is committed. If it's not, prompt me to commit and suggest the commit message. Follow the Arlo Belshee's commit notation
3. Do not approve the results of approvaltests. Prompt me and I'll approve it manually.
